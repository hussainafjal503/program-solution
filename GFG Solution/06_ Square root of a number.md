# Square root of a number

Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).

Example 1:

Input: x = 5 Output: 2 Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

Example 2:

Input: x = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.

Your Task: You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function floorSqrt() which takes x as the input parameter and return its square root. Note: Try Solving the question without using the sqrt function. The value of x>=0.

class Solution{
  public:
    long long int floorSqrt(long long int x) 
    {
        // Your code goes here   
        long long int start=0,end=x,mid,ans;
        while(start<=end)
        {
            mid=start+(end-start)/2;
            if(mid*mid==x)
            {
                ans=mid;
                return ans;
            }
            else if(mid*mid<x)
            {
                ans=mid;
                start=mid+1;
                
            }
            else
                end=mid-1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
